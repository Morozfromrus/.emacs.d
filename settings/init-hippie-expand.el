Flexible matching works by taking the search string and then
interspersing it with a regexp for any character. So, if you try
to do a flexible match for `foo' it will match the word
`findOtherOtter' but also `fixTheBoringOrange' and
`ifthisisboringstopreadingnow'.

The argument OLD has to be nil the first call of this function, and t
for subsequent calls (for further possible completions of the same
string).  It returns t if a new completion is found, nil otherwise."
